### 🧑‍💻 About Me

I'm a Computer Science and Mathematics undergraduate at **BITS Pilani**, with a deep interest in **backend systems**, **machine learning**, and building tools that blend automation with real-world productivity.

Over the past few years, I’ve worked on everything from forecasting rainfall using deep learning at a government research agency, to developing LLM-integrated workflows at a productivity startup.

### 🚀 What I'm Building (Stealth)

Currently building something I'm incredibly excited about — a **next-gen communication and outreach platform** that brings email, AI, and lead generation under one roof.

> Think high-performance cold outreach, beautifully reimagined — with tracking, AI-enhanced writing, and seamless Gmail integration. Whether you’re closing a sale or reaching out for your next job, it’s designed to work for you.

It’s still early days, but we believe it’s going to change how people manage conversations that matter.
